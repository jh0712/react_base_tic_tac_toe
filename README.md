### Practice Project 
- this project is for me to record my practice react project.
- for now:
  - tac-tic-toe
    - Lets you play tic-tac-toe, 
    - Indicates when a player has won the game,
    - Stores a game’s history as a game progresses, 
    - Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.
  - extra
    - For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
    - Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
    - add diff way to show square.
    - Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
    - When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
    - Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
